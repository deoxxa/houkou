Houkou
======

Teeny tiny router for node and the browser

Overview
--------

Houkou is a very simple (but surprisingly featureful) router written in
JavaScript, targeted towards both Node.JS and the browser. It has no external
dependencies and currently weighs in at just over a kilobyte uncompressed.

Features
--------

1. Simple, clear syntax
2. Named route parameters
3. Custom parameter regexes
4. Reverse routing (generate urls from routes)
5. Fully tested (check test directory)

Documentation
-------------

There's not much to be documented, fortunately! The example below should cover
just about everything (seriously). There's some tests in the test directory as
well if you want some more examples.

Example Usage
-------------

Code:

```javascript
var Houkou = require("houkou");

// create a new route
var route = new Houkou("/post/:id/:title", {requirements: {id: "[0-9]+"}});

// parse a url according to our route definition
var params = route.match("/post/123/this-is-an-example-post");

// print it out all pretty-like
console.log("Parsed:");
console.log(params);
console.log("");

// construct a url using our route as a template, filling in the variables with
// those supplied
var url = route.build(params);

// dump!
console.log("Generated:");
console.log(url);
console.log("");
```

Output:

```
Parsed:
{ id: '123', title: 'this-is-an-example-post' }

Generated:
/post/123/this-is-an-example-post
```
